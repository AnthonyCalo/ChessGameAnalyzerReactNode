# About project
Wukong JS is a didactic open source chess engine inteded to serve the purpose of helping people<br>
to kick start with their own chess engines from scratch. I've considered to pick up javascript as<br>
a weapon of choice programming language because one can start playing around with this boiler plate<br>
source code just right in the web browser without getting bothered by installing any environment,<br>
however it also works as a console application running via nodejs in UCI mode to play with other engines.<br>

# About author
My name is Maksim Korzh aka Code Monkey King. I'm doing chess programming as a hobby since 2018.<br>
It was incredibly difficult for me to write my very first chess engine because of the fact that available<br>
resources seemed to be a complete rocket science to me. Every next successful attempt to master<br>
a new aspect of chess programming brought me lots of joy and happiness, so eventually I've decided<br>
to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9-prLkPwgvlKKqDgXhsMQ/playlists">chess programming</a> YouTube channel to share my passion with others. A fun fact that<br>
after that <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Maksim_Korzh">me and my engines</a> were added to chess programming wikipedia.
